  | 2. <code>cat > portscan.py</code> | ![View](https://github.com/thechiragvaishnav-dotcom/Python-Network-Port-Scanner/issues/3#issue-3943797607) | |
  | 3. Enter | ![View](https://github.com/thechiragvaishnav-dotcom/Python-Network-Port-Scanner/issues/4#issue-3943813622) | |
  | 4. Ctrl + C | ![View](https://github.com/thechiragvaishnav-dotcom/Python-Network-Port-Scanner/issues/5#issue-3943822231) | |
  | 5. <code>ls</code> | ![View](https://github.com/thechiragvaishnav-dotcom/Python-Network-Port-Scanner/issues/6#issue-3943861328) | Here, you should see $$\color{white}{\text{portscan.py}}$$(file) not same color as as other $$\color{blue}{\text{directories}}$$ |

  write this inside portscan.py(file)\
  | 1. Using import in python<br><code>import socket</code><br><code>import subprocess</code><br><code>import sys</code> | ![View](https://github.com/thechiragvaishnav-dotcom/Python-Network-Port-Scanner/issues/9#issue-3944124498) | these are things that someone else coded in the Python language<br> that allows us to automate some of the stuff that we're going to be doing |
  | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | 2. Using datetime in Python<br><code>from datetime import datetime</code> | ![View](https://github.com/thechiragvaishnav-dotcom/Python-Network-Port-Scanner/issues/10#issue-3944134652) | 1. What we're doing here is<br>we want to be able to know what the current date & time is<br><br>2. The Reason for that is we're going to need to know,<br>here's when I Started, here's when I Ended |
  | 3. How to clear your screen in python<br><code>subprocess.call('clear', shell = True)</code> | ![View](https://github.com/thechiragvaishnav-dotcom/Python-Network-Port-Scanner/issues/11#issue-3944147958) | 1. Basically like <code>clear</code><br><br>$$\color{orange}{\text{2. Automatically clear the screen when we run this file}}$$<br><br>3. So that for next input we can see that on the wider screen |
  | 4. Asking for input in Python<br><code>remoteServer = input("Enter a remote host to scan: ")</code><br><code>remoteServerIP = socket.gethostbyname(remoteServer)</code> | ![View](https://github.com/thechiragvaishnav-dotcom/Python-Network-Port-Scanner/issues/12#issue-3944171652)<br>![*View](https://github.com/thechiragvaishnav-dotcom/Python-Network-Port-Scanner/issues/13#issue-3944211197)  | 1. we're defining remoteServer here as this particular function,<br> & then we say, enter a remote host to scan.<br><br>2. The remoteServerIP is going to be the result of what<br>you enter when it asks you to enter the remote host to scan. |
  | 5. Printing information in Python <br><code>print("-" * 60)</code><br><code>print("Please wait, scanning remote host", remoteServerIP)</code><br><code>print("-" * 60)</code> | ![View](https://github.com/thechiragvaishnav-dotcom/Python-Network-Port-Scanner/issues/14#issue-3944320235) | Basically like a Banner<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------<br>Please wait, scanning remote host <your input's IP><br>---------------------------------------------------------- |
  | 6. Checking the date & time in Python<br><code>t1 = datetime.now()</code> | ![View](https://github.com/thechiragvaishnav-dotcom/Python-Network-Port-Scanner/issues/15#issue-3944344311) | 1. Check the date & time the scan was started.<br><br>2. we're defining t1 as the current date & time.<br><br>3. That way, at any point in our code we can say t1 & it will actually tell us what the current date & time is without us having to type out that long function(<code>datetime.now()</code>) again.<br><br>4. That's the purpose of doing that. |
  | 7. Using a function to specify ports in Python<br><code>try:</code><br><code>    for port in range(1,5000):</code> | ![View](https://github.com/thechiragvaishnav-dotcom/Python-Network-Port-Scanner/issues/16#issue-3944375510) | 1. we say, for port in range. This is What we call a for loop.<br><br>2. In other words, it's a way to repeat something 5000 times(instead of writing 5000 codes) over & over again.<br><br>3. What we're doing here is we're going to scan all ports between one & 5000.<br><br>4. So we're going to check that on each IP address we scan. |
  | <br><code>try:</code><br><code>    for port in range(1,5000):</code><br><code>        sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)</code> | ![View](https://github.com/thechiragvaishnav-dotcom/Python-Network-Port-Scanner/issues/17#issue-3944397518) | # Buying the Phone<br>1. <code>sock = </code><br>This is just a variable name.<br><br>2. <code>socket.socket(...)</code><br>$$\color{orange}{\text{What it is:}}$$ This is the command to $$\color{orange}{\text{create}}$$ the object. You are call the $$\color{orange}{\text{socket}}$$ Library(which you imported at the top) & asking it to build a new socket for you.<br>$$\color{orange}{\text{Analogy:}}$$ This is like walking into a store and saying, $$\color{orange}{\text{"I would like to buy a communication device please".}}$$<br><br>3. <code>socket.AF_INET</code><br>$$\color{orange}{\text{What it is:}}$$ This tells the socket what kind of $$\color{orange}{\text{address}}$$ you will be using<br>$$\color{orange}{\text{  AF}}$$ = Address Family<br>$$\color{orange}{\text{  INET}}$$ = Internet(specifically IPv4)<br>$$\color{orange}{\text{Translation:}}$$ "I will be using standard IP(like 192.168.1.5), not weird futuristic ones(IPv6) or local paths". <br> $$\color{orange}{\text{Analogy:}}$$ You are telling the store clerk, "I want a device that uses $$\color{orange}{\text{standard phone numbers}}$$(xxx-xxx-xxx) not email addresses". <br><br>4. <code>socket.SOCK_STREAM</code><br>$$\color{orange}{\text{What it is:}}$$ This tells the socket how to talk.<br><code>  SOCK_STREAM</code><br>means a "Stream" socket, which uses $$\color{orange}{\text{TCP}}$$(Transmission Control Protocol)<br>$$\color{orange}{\text{Why TCP?}}$$ TCP is reliable it creates a solid connection(like a phone call) where you say "Hello?" & wait for an aswer.<br>the other option is $$\color{orange}{\text{UDP}}$$(User Datagram Protocol), which is like throwing a letter in the mail-you don't know if it arrived.<br>$$\color{orange}{\text{Analogy:}}$$ You are telling the clerk, "I want to make a $$\color{orange}{\text{live phone call}}$$ where we stay on the line, not just send a text message".<br><br>$$\color{orange}{\text{Putting it all together}}$$<br>When you write this line,<br><code>sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)</code><br>you are telling Python: "Create a new connection tool called <code>sock</code>. Make sure it uses $$\color{orange}{\text{IPv4 addresses}}$$(<code>AF_INET</code>) & communicates using a $$\color{orange}{\text{reliable TCP connection}}$$(<code>SOCK_STREAM</code>)".
